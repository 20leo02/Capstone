Hi, I'm Tems and here are five things you don't know about

00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:04.780
my music.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Number one is almost all of my music is freestyles.

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:19.000
It all came from freestyles it's just me freestyling

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:23.000
the whole way through. Number two is that I have cried while

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:28.000
making some of the songs because they were very personal to me...

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:32.000
maybe that was too personal (chuckles) but yeah... it's true.

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:38.000
My favorite city to perform? Right now I don't have a favorite city

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:43.000
to perform. I really want to perform in Paris, I think that might be

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:48.000
life-changing. So I have a song called "Free Mind" and when I was making

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:53.000
that song there's a sample in the beginning that is like... it sounds

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:57.000
like a howl? A lot of people don't know that I sang it into my laptop,

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:03.000
I didn't have a mic when I made that song so I put my laptop speaker

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:10.000
to my mouth and I sang the song sample in. What inspires me most is

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:16.000
the season I am in in life coupled with music that I've heard, people

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:22.000
that I love: Frank Ocean, Asha, Sade. Those are the people that inspire

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:32.000
me and help me in my process.
