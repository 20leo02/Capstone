00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.550
There is a bar chart labeled

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.830
"Employment for disabled and non-disabled Americans."

00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:07.840
The x-axis is 1991 and 2010

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:11.510
and the y-axis goes from 0 to 100%.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.000
The graph shows that in 1991,

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.390
disabled Americans were employed at 50.2%

00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:21.810
while non-disabled Americans were employed at 84.4%.

00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:25.050
In 2010, the percentage of disabled Americans

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.310
employed drops to 41.1% and non-disabled Americans

00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:31.760
drops to 79.1%.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.544
As you can see

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:33.608
the employment rate

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:34.702
for Americans without disabilities

00:00:34.703 --> 00:00:36.000
is much higher

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.511
than those with disabilities.

00:00:39.728 --> 00:00:40.302
In general,

00:00:40.451 --> 00:00:42.085
we have seen people with disabilities

00:00:42.086 --> 00:00:43.603
employed at nearly half the rate

00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:45.540
of those without disabilities.
