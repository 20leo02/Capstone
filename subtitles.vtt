00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
Hi, I'm Tems and here are five things you don't know about

00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:04.780
my music.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Number one is almost all of my music is freestyles.

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:19.000
It all came from freestyles it's just me freestyling

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:23.000
the whole way through. Number two is that I have cried while

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:28.000
making some of the songs because they were very personal to me...

00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:32.000
maybe that was too personal (chuckles) but yeah... it's true.

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:38.000
My favorite city to perform? Right now I don't have a favorite city

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:43.000
to perform. I really want to perform in Paris, I think that might be

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:48.000
life-changing. So I have a song called "Free Mind" and when I was making

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:53.000
that song there's a sample in the beginning that is like... it sounds

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:57.000
like a howl? A lot of people don't know that I sang it into my laptop,

00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:03.000
I didn't have a mic when I made that song so I put my laptop speaker

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:10.000
to my mouth and I sang the song sample in. What inspires me most is

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:16.000
the season I am in in life coupled with music that I've heard, people

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:22.000
that I love: Frank Ocean, Asha, Sade. Those are the people that inspire

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:31.000
me and help me in my process.

00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:34.500
Interviewer: For you it's a song you made it's a personal thing and then

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:38.500
you start seeing like "Okay this is going to do more than I expected like

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:41.000
when did that moment come for you?"

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Libianca: Uhh... the night after I posted the song on Tiktok. I woke up,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
you know, my manager--he's my best friend too but - my manager wakes me up

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:58.000
in the morning and is like "Bianca you have to see this... Lib you have to

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.000
see this s**t man you have to see-" I'm like "What's going on?" I'm not a

00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:07.000
morning person so I'm just I'm already like "C'mon." I wake up and we see

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:12.000
videos being done to the sound already and it's already at 80,000 views

00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:17.000
and at that time 80,000 or you know anything higher than 50,000 views

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:21.500
to be honest was something that will come maybe every two weeks or

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:25.000
so from my page. And so that happening I was like "Aaa wow!"

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Interviewer: Mhmmm... mhmmm.

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:29.500
and then by the second from there it was just like you refresh

00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:32.000
and it's like +10,000 followers and you refresh and it's plus

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:37.000
another 10,000 it's like "Okay." And I just... i just froze I mean I

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:40.000
didn't... I didn't know what to do so...

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:45.500
Diamond Platnumz: So then... I said like... they started calling me

00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:47.000
"Diamond Diamond, oh Diamond Diamond" and I was like Diamond in

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:52.500
Swahili you say "Almasi." I said like, on that time I didn't see

00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:55.000
anybody calling themself or any artist calling themself Diamond

00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:58.500
I said “Why should I use that name?” I start to call myself

00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:01.000
“Diamond, Diamond.” You know what I’m saying “”Diamond Plantumz”

00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:05.000
Platnumz means swag, means looking fresh, good as… you can see you know…

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.250
looking fresh that means Platnumz so “Diamond Platnum,” Diamond

00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:10.000
who is looking good 24/7 (laughs).

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Interviewer: What do you think is… is is better in terms of

00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:20.000
staying passionate or… or or going into the mainstream?

00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:24.000
Like how do you balance those two things out especially

00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:26.000
right now in your place?

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.000
ElGrandeToto: Mmmmm… I don’t give a f**k about mainstream

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:33.500
like if I do something mainstream I do it just because

00:03:33.501 --> 00:03:37.000
it’s the vibe... cuz' I got cuz’ I had the vibe to do it.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Interviewer: Okay.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
ElGrandeToto: You know I don’t calculate that much.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.500
Interviewer: What about for the check? If the if the check is

00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:49.500
right would you do it for the mainstream? If the money’s right?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.500
ElGrandeToto: Mmmmm… like a full album with full mainstream s**t?

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:59.000
Interviewer: I’m talking you get a major comethrough and they supply

00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:03.500
you with everything you need but they may have a say in the creative

00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:05.000
conversations that happen.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
*ElGrandeToto shaking head no*

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Interviewer: No deal (chuckles)?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Tyla: Hello guys, I’m Tyla and I’m at PreMagazine

00:04:14.001 --> 00:04:16.500
about to take a snack test.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.000
Theme song: They must go crazy…

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:30.000
Tyla: Is this… an ASMR? Aah okay… Mhmmm… So I was born and raised in

00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:35.000
Johannesburg, South Africa. Well when I was younger, I always wanted

00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:40.000
to be from America. I always was like “Ugh, I wish I was born in America”

00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:44.000
just because I used to watch so many YouTube videos of people in America.

00:04:44.001 --> 00:04:48.500
Umm… but as I grew up I realized how amazing my childhood was in South African

00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:52.500
like the culture, the people, the music, the vibe… so yeah growing up in

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:58.000
South Africa was like the best childhood and I wouldn’t change it for anything.
